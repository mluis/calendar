DESCRIPTION:\nBureaucracy\, unclarity and technical debt are just some of m
 any obstacles teams face when making product development. Developers need t
 o be challenged to solve real problems\, that’s how we are motivated.\n\nDo
 main-driven design is a philosophy described by Eric Evans that tackles tho
 se concerns effectively and helps to engage team members at their full capa
 bilities. By defining domain models that project realities in bounded conte
 xts\, developers can elaborate clear perceptions of the business. Therefore
 \, domain problems are identified in advance and real value is added to the
  product.\n\nIt’s been an amazing journey since we adopted DDD\, almost one
  year ago. I will talk about its inner concepts\, our progress as a team an
 d what we plan to achieve.\n\n[speaker: Miguel Alpendre\, https://pixels.ca

DESCRIPTION:In a monolithic application we don't need to worry about breaki
 ng contracts between different services because the compiler will do that j
 ob for us. If a given method signature changes\, the contract between share
 d services is broken\, and the build will automatically fail.\n\nIn a micro
 services application\, we have a whole new scenario where different service
 s are deployed in different runtimes and don't know anything about each oth
 ers. We don't have the compiler to detect those breaking changes and they b
 ecame hard to detect. Usually\, they're found during end-to-end testing in 
 a pre-production environment.\n\nWe need to ensure that when we deploy a ne
 w service into production\, our changes won't break any consumer\; We can d
 o this kind of testing without the need of a real consumer by using consume
 r-driven contracts.\n\nIn this talk\, I will show you how to implement cons
 umer-driven contracts and we'll move TDD to the level of software architect
 ure.\n\n[speaker: Pedro Tavares\, https://pixels.camp/ordepdev]\n[language:

DESCRIPTION:An engineer starts playing a new game... and then... birds chir

 ivor\, he has to harvest his resources by hand in order to build up an indu
 strial infrastructure to eventually build a rocket and send a satellite to 
 space\, while facing inhabitants of the planet who defend their native envi
 ronment from the pollution and destruction by the player.\nSome words sound
  familiar!? That's right!\n\nThis talk will cover how you can deploy a Fact
 orio server to AWS in an affordable and yet scalable way (so you can play l
 ong nights with as many friends as you want).\n\nIt will explore common Inf
 rastructure as Code tools like Ansible\, Packer\, Terraform as well as AWS 
 specific products like EC2 Spot Instances\, Lambda and API Gateway.\n\n[spe

 products twice (or more). But wouldn't it be great if we could develop an a

 at.\n\nIf you've seen our previous talks and/or read our "World Security Re
 port" for 2016 (ise.binaryedge.io) you know that we have found some of the 
 weirdest things online. From water dams\, to electricity grids\, and nuclea

 . And in this talk\, we are going to explore the top "things" we've found e
 xposed\, talk about the different protocols they use and also allow YOU liv

 se our 2017 report\, where we show how we detected some of the NSA tools su
 ch as Double pulsar. We will also make an interesting reveal on this topic.

DESCRIPTION:One of the things that always excited me after having started t
 o program for a living was how could systems be designed in a way that you 
 could increase its capacity\, not by making brilliant micro-optimizations t
 hat are only within reach of a few enlighted individuals or the most dilige
 nt benchmarkers\, but just by Throwing Money at the Problem™ (as in: adding
  more machines). Having come to realise that in order to make it happen I s
 hould learn this thing called "Distributed Systems"\, I've started my journ
 ey (more of walk on the desert\, actually) from zero to hero. Spoiler alert
 : the first step was understanding there is a lot more that can be achieved
  other than increasing the system's throughput\, such as reduced latency or
  increased availability and storage capacity.\n\nIf you share this belief t
 hat some problems can be better solved (or at all) by having multiple machi
 nes collaborating and have some interest (or need) in knowing how could you
  do that\, I'll try not to disappoint you. Far from having reached the "her
 o" stage\, I believe I can supply you with enough tools to avoid making the
  same mistakes I've made or had to deal with by sharing concrete advice on 
 what you should have in mind when reading about the subject\, bootstrapping
  your first prototypes or building\, tuning and extending systems that use 
 this kind of stuff.\n\n[speaker: Gabriel Candal\, https://pixels.camp/gcand

DESCRIPTION:Monads are an advanced programming concept that can be used in 
 any computer language by beginners.\n\nThey are also known to be very hard

 nIn this talk I don't intend to explain what they are or how they work (way

 ded to center the subject on the usual canonical programming examples that 
 are used to explain your typical programming paradigms\, that way I hope to
  enable the audacious to decompose any problem with monads.\n\nI will lead 
 the audience through a set of carefully collided examples so that they can 
 see past the magical mythical golden aura that Monads have and realize the 
 true trash cans that they really are.\n\n[speaker: Hugo Gomes\, https://pix

DESCRIPTION:Data Pitch is a EU-funded open innovation programme bringing to
 gether corporate and public-sector organisations that have data with startu
 ps and SMEs that work with data.\n\nIt is centred around a competition with
  several tracks which describe challenges\, and a virtual accelerator progr
 amme (6 months) to help startups and SMEs develop solutions to meet these c
 hallenges. The startups and SMEs will put forward proposals for creating hi
 gh impact\, innovative products and services in response to the challenges 
 defined by Data Pitch. Successful applicants will receive an important fina
 ncial and advisory boost to their idea\, with support to develop a concept 
 into a robust and sustainable business.\n\n[speaker: Bashara Hinnawi\, http

DESCRIPTION:Gamification is one of the top buzzwords of the business world.
  But what does that mean for developers?\n\nWhat is gamification when you t
 ake out the fluffy managerial terminology and how can it impact the day-to-
 day of a dev team?\n\nHow can we make it a reality? What frameworks\, engin
 es\, platforms\, etc are out there and which ones to choose?\n\nShould we b
 e making our own? If so\, what are the main pitfalls when implementing a ga
 mification engine?\n\nIn this talk\, I'll define gamification and break it 
 down to the main elements\, visit some success cases and share some stories
  of the road of a developer-turned-gamification-designer trying to change t
 he world.\n\n[speaker: Manuel Pimenta\, https://www.linkedin.com/in/manuelp

DESCRIPTION:The advent of augmented\, virtual and mixed reality has created
  a new demand for 3D applications and visualizations. Once the domain of ga
 mes and entertainment\, now productivity is driving the new wave for MR exp
 eriences. We are at a crossroads where users live in a mobile\, wireless an
 d on-demand world but high-end 3D applications are stuck tethered to large 
 desktops and wired headsets.\n\nThe 3D Streaming Toolkit was started to pro
 vide a solution to this problem. Using the toolkit\, you can deliver an unc
 ompromised experience to your users on any mobile platform or device. The p
 urpose is to provide an open toolkit to enable industries to leverage remot
 e cloud rendering in their service and product pipelines. This is required 
 for many industries where the scale and complexity of 3D models\, scenes\, 
 physics and rendering is beyond the capabilities of a mobile device platfor
 m. We are extending the industry standard WebRTC framework to 3D scenarios 
 including mixed reality and will walk through the work we are doing to real
 ize the goal of delivering high-quality 3D applications to any client - web
 \, mobile\, desktop and embedded.\n\n[speaker: Tyler Gibson\, http://www.th

 to (keep) write Clean Code as in the book.\n\nIt Starks from a interpretati
 on of what is Clean and ends with the outcomes of a (four months) proof of 
 concept for the Android platform.\n\n- What I as running away from\, when a
  stumble over Clean.\n- A glimpse of what is Clean. (To a full understandin
 g Robert C. Martin is the best).\n- How implementing Clean can be exciting 
 for developers\, and at the same time ensures a long life to the project.\n

DESCRIPTION:Sharing passwords and secrets have always been a big "headache"
  for Security and Ops Teams\, because not only these teams want to control 
 who has access to what\, but want to be able to react faster when there is 
 the suspicion that a leak has happened. Two simple examples are when Dev te
 am want's to run a Data Repair Script\, they need to either create a contai
 ner and have Ops inject the credentials they need via Env Variables (Not re
 commended) or they need to send the script to Ops\, have them modify it wit
 h the credentials and execute it (Error Prone). The other example is when a
 ttackers gain access to your database credentials by exploring remote-code 
 execution exploits to dump the Environment Variables\, you want to be able 
 to invalidate old credentials and generate new ones quickly.\n\nThis talk w
 ill introduce you to Vault by HashiCorp. I'll show you some use-cases and w
 orkflows on how we can control access to services in general just by using 
 Tokens.\n\n[speaker: Luís Duarte\, https://pixels.camp/driverpt]\n[language

DESCRIPTION:How can enterprise software be exciting\, challenging and fast?
  Enterprise grade systems are most of times linked to boring\, heavy and sl
 ow software development\, however that's not true!\n\nWhat is an enterprise
  grade system? Is it really different from others? Is there space for innov
 ation? How fast can you move? What are the myths and the realities of build
 ing such systems?\n\nIn this talk I will speak about my journey on building
  an enterprise grade system that has the strongest requirements of performa
 nce\, security and availability at the same time that innovation was and st
 ill is essential for our survival. How we have introduced new technology in
 to the product\, the strong partnerships with top technology companies like
  Datastax or Azul Systems that build high performance platforms like Cassan
 dra and Zing JVM\, and the state of the art processes to deliver quality so
 ftware for Fortune 500 corporations.\n\nA brief walk-through on building a 
 real time distributed system that can't fail or slow down and that raises t
 he bar to any Machine Learning pipeline.\n\n[speaker: Diogo Guerra\, https:

DESCRIPTION:Not all applications are born the same: some are subject to hig
 h load\, others will be hit by a couple of requests every once in a while\;
  some will be fed with loads and loads of data\, others will deal with a co
 uple of MBytes from time to time\; some are built with performance as a non
 -functional requirement\, other are "just made to work".\n\nEither way\, as
  a developer\, it's important to know how to find performance issues on an 
 application under heavy load while also getting to know the factors that ar
 e a constraint to the performance like a database or some library in use.\n
 \nIn this session\, we'll be submitting a web application to a load test an

DESCRIPTION:Testing… everyone knows it exists\, some talk about it\, few do

 d of the production line of a software product\, that says ‘yey’ or ‘nei’. 
 For that\, test automation is a must. And test automation is often neglecte
 d.\n\nBy exploring the test pyramid we will give a context for each type an
 d which metrics we should use. It will be an open discussion about who\, wh
 y and when we should test.\n\nWe have been implementing automation in Mobil

 and updates\, automated pipelines and other activities that help decreasing
  the time spent in each release/merge and at the same time increase the sta
 bility of the products.\n\n[speaker: Fábio Barbosa\, https://pixels.camp/Fa

DESCRIPTION:Since some years\, I am being developing OpenSource firmware fo

 hicules: hoverboards\, skates\, unicycles and bicycles.\n\nThis chinese con
 trollers are dirty cheap\, capable and with ok quality. Since they optimize
  their products for price\, they have very limited resources - developing f
 irmware for their controllers means learning how to make "the thing" in a u
 nique and creative ways\, optimizing all the processing power and memory us

 e controllers? Because the market is flooded with them: they work well and 
 are easy to get. This OpenSource firmware is the first in the world and I h
 ope it will be used by many users as possible\, shapping the future like Ar
 duino did.\n\nI would like to present my experience\, from developing the f
 irmware and up to try gather a community and contact with people all over t

DESCRIPTION:Startups often start out by developing MVPs that fit all needs 
 of their product offering. Billing\, user management\, invoicing\, etc. It'
 s all crammed up in the same place. The so called monolith. This can lead t
 o various problems: running the deployment pipeline now takes ages\, that f
 laky test you didn't write is breaking and it is now your responsibility to
  fix it\, you're dependent on deploy times of other teams to release your f
 eature\, etc.\n\nIn this talk\, I'm going to try and convince you on why yo
 u should embrace a microservices-oriented architecture and how you can effe
 ctively achieve a successful transition. It will be based on a real-life sc
 enario of extracting two microservices out of an existing monolith. By the 
 end of this talk\, you'll hopefully have an idea about why the following ar
 e important\, and what role each of these play in this process of breaking 
 the monolith.\n\n[speaker: Daniel Serrano\, https://pixels.camp/dnlserrano]

DESCRIPTION:In this talk you will learn why Machine Learning and Data Scien
 ce are much more than algorithms. Out there\, in real world industrial appl
 ications\, it is a complex and intertwined mix of technology\, domain const
 raints\, intuition and team-work. Using real stories from Feedzai's experie
 nce fighting fraud in payments\, we will illustrate why applying machine le
 arning to live systems goes beyond using a dataset to train a predictive mo
 del. Technological issues such as scale\, class balancing\, concept drift\,
  and data cleaning are a challenge to any data scientist\, but they are onl
 y part of the story. In this talk\, we will also show how non-technological
  issues can be so hard\, and why good practices can have a tremendous impac
 t on results.\n\n[speaker: Jaime Ferreira\, https://pixels.camp/jaimerferre

 continuous integration workplace. Be it webpages\, microservices\, topologi

 side. You have to make the computer wait or sleep because something is not 
 ready.\n\nForget about standard "waiting". There are new techniques that ar
 e not known by many\, but that make waiting in tests smarter. Some of these
  techniques will be live demonstrated for a typical frontend application te

DESCRIPTION:Have you considered auditing your source code using static anal
 ysis tools? What do these things pick up that you can't with a code review?
  How do they work?\n\nSoftware security concerns have fortunately been incr
 easing over the last few years\, certainly due to the continuous growing nu
 mber of threats being thrown at our applications every day. Still\, not eve
 ry project's contributor is a software security expert and hiring one to pe
 rform thorough code reviews for each contribution can be unsustainable.\n\n
 This is where SAST (Static Application Security Testing) comes in. These to
 ols rely on static source code analysis to parse and query abstract syntax 
 trees\, or parse trees\, inferring potential vulnerabilities without having
  a running system. The basic components of these tools will be discussed as
  well as their pros and cons.\n\n[speaker: José Pereira\, https://pixels.ca

DESCRIPTION:... or how I over-engineered a bunch of sensors.\n\nI spent the
  last year working on a smart office. But this wasn't going to be just any 
 smart office. It had to be capable of doing everything. And also anything .
  And it had to be distributed . And handle big data . And work offline . An
 d support DIY stuff . And buzzwords. Also\, it had to be cool and hip and r
 un on Elixir .\n\nThe adventure begins when I wanted to optimise the produc
 tivity of our office at Subvisual by managing environmental values: tempera
 ture\, humidity\, sound levels and lighting. My first goal was to constantl
 y display those readings and warn us if any of them was sub-optimal. I some
 how got sidetracked and ended up with a P2P network in a distributed archit
 ecture or smth.\n\nIn this talk\, I'll go through the implementation of a d
 istributed architecture for a smart office. We will figure out how to conne
 ct Raspberries\, Beaglebones and what not. Then go through distributed syst
 ems stuff like figure out if we want a server or P2P protocols and how to u
 se eventual consistency. We'll get to know how to modify the P2P network to
  add any custom DIY node\, but we'll mostly end up by collectively shaming 
 myself for tapping into my developer's heart and pulling out what's at its 
 core: a bunch of not-so-brilliant\, over-engineered ideas.\n\n[speaker: Fer

DESCRIPTION:Functional programming alongside lambda calculus\, immutability
 \, and static type checking are all hot topics which appear on many softwar
 e development circles. The rising trend of such a paradigm for backend deve
 lopment has leaked into the frontend and has made several languages based o
 n it emerge.\n\nThe Elm programming language is part of this new set of lan
 guages aimed for the presentation layer. Elm - based on Haskell - makes use
  of these ideas in order to equip the programmer with extraordinary develop
 ment powers. The language compiles to Javascript and aims to offer zero run
 time exceptions\, great performance due to its own Virtual DOM implementati
 on\, and extreme confidence in refactorings.\n\nIn this talk I'll present t
 he language from the viewpoint of someone experienced in this paradigm but 
 also as a beginner to the client side of things.\n\n[speaker: Sasha Fonseca

DESCRIPTION:Reactive is the new black\, Everyone talks about it\, everyone 
 wants it! However the definition is quite fuzzy\, what does it mean? Reacti
 ve Programming? Reactive Systems? Functional Reactive Programming?\n\nIn th
 is talk I will focus on the first two: Reactive Programming and Reactive Sy
 stems. Reactive programming has become mainstream in the JavaScript communi
 ty\, both on the server side with NodeJS as well on the frontend side with 
 React.js. Finally it is catching up on the Java community with Vert.x and S
 pring 5. But are all these platforms\, reactive systems? The answer is: No!
  We will demystify the differences and tear down false believes!\n\nThis ta
 lk is not for the faint of hear! Be prepared to see your stack being put to
  the test and perhaps it will prevail!\n\n[speaker: Paulo Lopes\, https://p

DESCRIPTION:It's starting to become common knowledge that Microservices app
 roach to systems architecture is the way to go. This is insanely dangerous 
 and most of the times you're actually much better served with a glorified a
 nd well structured monolith instead. In this talk I'll try to bring some se
 nse to the microservices craze by killing some myths around Monoliths\, exp
 osing the hardships of a Microservices oriented architecture and providing 
 some tips on when should you start thinking about breaking your monolith up
 . Microservices bandwagon party goers\, let's talk for a few minutes.\n\n[s

DESCRIPTION:As a data engineer\, part of my job is to find the best ways to
  transform and work with data. During this path\, I’ve come across with Clo
 jure. Clojure opened my mind in the way I approach the development of softw
 are and it made me question many of my dogmas (e.g. Object Oriented Program
 ming). My purpose for this talk is to share those findings with you. These 
 include (but are not limited to):\n\n- software programs can be modeled as 
 transducers\;\n- the implicit context and complexity of object orientation\
 ;\n- mutation of state\, the root of all evil\;\n- functional programming b
 oosts productivity and confidence\n- Clojure opens the mind to new ways of 
 testing\n- functional programs are a lot easier to scale and the industry i
 s moving in that direction (e.g just take a look into Java 8 and 9)\n\n[spe

DESCRIPTION:This is a Workshop to explore BIG Data using python pandas and 
 other tools (or how to efficiently deal with lots of data in a laptop) The 
 keyword of the workshop will be: efficiency\n\npandas is an open source\, B
 SD-licensed library providing high-performance\, easy-to-use data structure
 s and data analysis tools for the Python programming language. It's being w
 idely used by scientists across multiple fields.\n\nIf you want a hands-on 
 experience on how to use pandas\, and how it can befit you\, this is the wo
 rkshop to go! I've used it to cleanup data\, transform it\, and create each
  user anonymized profile. Later it was also easy to process profile based r
 ecommendations\, where I would score 10k items on a laptop in under 60ms.\n
 \nWe're going to explore the basic API's of pandas to do in memory transfor
 mation\, filter\, groups\, joins\, etc... In the process we will learn abou
 t jupyter notebooks which are also being used in science not only to do tri
 al and errors\, but also to share the results and how they were achieved\, 
 enabling repeatability.\n\nFor the workshop we will process generated data 
 for a possible EPG and Activity Log (each attendant will generate their own
  data\, so no repeatability here :D ). We will then extract data from the l
 og\, and process it. In the end of the workshop we should be able to give i
 tem to item recommendations based on what people watched...\n\n[speaker: Al

 gineering challenges and the evolution of an idea for a platform\; through 
 a series of challenges\, trade-offs and binding decisions\, an engineering 
 team worked towards a common goal: build a stable foundation where others c

 Initial architectural goals: disentangle responsabilities from a monolith w
 hile empowering a crescendo of internal teams and why this matters.\n- Firs
 t iterations: achieved goals vs missing promises\, let's talk about both.\n
 - A public API: the idea of an MVP we can stand for.\n- Working as a team: 
 how to deliver value for multiple stakeholders on a tight deadline\, collab
 orate and work effectively as a team.\n\n[speaker: Tiago Sousa\, https://pi

 ing until we realised it was just renting VMs in someone else's datacenter.
  We couldn't escape "servers". Until now...\n\nIn this session\, developers
  will learn how to build microservices without servers\, using modern “serv
 erless” cloud platforms. We’ll look at common challenges (and solutions) to
  building applications using “serverless” stacks. Exploring emerging “serve
 rless” design patterns will give developers the knowledge to build applicat
 ion architectures using these new platforms.\n\nThis session is aimed at so
 ftware developers experienced in building traditional backend web applicati
 ons\, who want to learn how to build microservices managing infrastructure.
